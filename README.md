# Cryptography Terms!!!!! # 
## Frequency Analysis ##
 * Cracking a code by looking at the amount of times different letters or “cribs” appear in the message. *
## Vigenere Cipher ##
 * For the **length** of the key, the message is encrypted with an equal amount of scrambled alphabets. *
 * Can be cracked by looking at repeating parts of the code to figure out the length of the key, which then can be cracked using **frequency analysis**. *
## Brute Force ##
 * The process of deciphering an encrypted message via trying **every possible method** (caesar, monoalphabetic, vigenere, etc.) **sequentially** until the message is decrypted *
 * The effectiveness of Brute Forcing is constantly **growing** as computers become **more and more  *powerful* ,** allowing for more combinations to be tried in a shorter period of time *
